# A Port to Xamarin of Aaron Bratcher's TableViewHelper for iOS
This is a port of Aaron Bratchers TableViewHelper for iOS https://github.com/AaronBratcher/TableViewHelper

I have taken the code provided by Aaron Bratcher and ported it over to C# in the Xamarin framework.

There are probably some weird discrepencies or mistakes but the general idea is working.  I was unsure how to apply the date picker well in a UITableViewCell so I went through his code and re wrote it in C#. 

I hope this helps someone.  If there are any glaring mistakes please feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to fix them
